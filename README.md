# Maze Game 

program an imaginary maze game. 

At the beginning of the game, you have 3 swords and 3 potions. Playersâ€™ initial points are set to 0.
The game begins with you in the middle of a maze (just an imagination, not a real maze).
The game should operate in a continuous loop. In each iteration of the loop, the player is prompted to 
input a direction to move Left, Right, Up, or Down by entering either L, R, U or D.
